/**
 * Talents the dark-heresy pack never shipped.
 *
 * A query over all 774 items found none of these by name. The Untouchable
 * talents are the set on p. 92-93, available to a character with the Untouchable
 * elite advance — the advance itself is already modelled in
 * script/creation/elite-data.mjs, only its talents were missing. The Sisters of
 * Battle Faith Talents are on p. 297.
 *
 * "Inquisitor" is deliberately absent: it is not a talent, and the elite-advance
 * module already records that it is granted by a serving Inquisitor's decree
 * rather than bought with experience.
 *
 * The text is the book's own wording, not a paraphrase.
