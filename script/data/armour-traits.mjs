 * Armour granted by creature traits.

 * Natural Armour (DH2 p. 136): "Gain additional Armour points to all locations."
 * The trait's own text adds: "Natural Armour stacks with worn armour, but not
 * with the Machine trait."
 *
 * Machine (X) (DH2 p. 137): "Machines have a certain number of Armour points
 * (indicated by the number in parentheses). This armour stacks with worn armour,
 * but not with the Natural Armour trait", and it does not protect against Fire
 * (p. 243). That fire exclusion belongs to the damage path, not here, and it is
 * the printed rule rather than a defect: a creature burning in its own plating
 * is exactly what the book describes.
 *
 * Both traits printed a value that nothing in the system ever read.
 *
 * The value lives in the item's name, as "Machine (5)", because that is how the
 * books write it and how a GM adds it to a sheet.
